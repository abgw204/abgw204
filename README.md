## ABOUT ME
I'm 21 years old boy and I started programming last year.<br/>
Software engineering student at 42, the 6th world's most innovative university which originated in Paris, France.<br>
Studying at 42 is very enriching due to the peer-to-peer learning method, which allows us not only to learn, but also to teach other colleagues, which makes us learn even more.<br>
Besides the 42, I'm also studying Analysis, Development and Integration of Systems (distance learning) in a Brazilian university.<br>
I have good fluency in English due to some speaker friends on the internet (and 4 years of taking a face-to-face course).<br/>
I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br/>
