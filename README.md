## ABOUT ME
I'm 21 years old boy and I recently started programming.<br/>
Software engineering student in 42, the 6th world's most innovative university which originated in Paris, France.<br>
Studying at 42 is very enriching due to the peer-to-peer learning method, which allows us not only to learn, but also to teach other colleagues, which makes us learn even more.<br>
Besides the 42, I'm also studying Analysis, Development and Integration of Systems (distance learning) in a brazilian university.<br>
I have good fluency in English due to some speaker friends on internet (and 4 years taking a face to face course).<br/>
I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br/>
