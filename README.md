## ABOUT ME
I'm 20 years old boy and I recently started programming.<br/>
Currently studying like hell to improve my skills (HTML, CSS, JS, C and Python at the moment).<br/>
Good fluency in English due to some speaker friends on internet (and 4 years taking a face to face course).<br/>
I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br/>
## HOBBIES
I play the piano and watch f1 (LET'S GO LANDO).<br/>
Don't do any sports that often, but I like table tennis a lot.<br/>
As any nerd out there, I play games like cs, siege, terraria, dark souls and so on.<br/>
I'm currently learning polish because my favorite classical composer (Frédéric Chopin) and my best friend (Emilka) are polish. kurwaaa!<br/>
